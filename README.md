Here, we aim to develop a system based on face recognition technique with the help of Convolution Neural Networks. Transfer learning method can be applied on pretrained CNN for higher accuracy and reliability. These networks are effective in face recognition and effective against frauds. With the help of IoT and relays, we can control electrical appliances based on total strength present in class.
